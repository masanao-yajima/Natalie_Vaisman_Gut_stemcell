Project Description

  Investigating if the presence of a bacteria called Wolbachia in Intestinal Stem Cells of fruit flies is altering the division rate of those cells. Basically, I have 6 guts and roughly 1000 cells/gut, some with bacteria and some without. I want to consult which types of statistical tests should I do to compare division rates intra and inter guts.

Data Preparation
 	excell spreadsheet with all the necessary numbers and proportions calculated.
